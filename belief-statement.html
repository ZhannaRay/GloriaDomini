            <h2 class="heading-tretiary heading-tretiary-center">Statement of Belief</br> Gloria Domini Classical Community</h2>
            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">God</h3>

            <p class="base-text">
              We believe in the only true God (John 17:3), the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Matthew
28:18-20). He created all things (Revelation 4:11) and upholds all things by the Word of His
power (Hebrews 1:3). In Him we live and move and have our being (Acts 17:28). He is a God of
truth and without iniquity; He is just and right (Deuteronomy 32:4); and He shall judge the world
(Psalm 9:8).
            </p>
            <p class="base-text">
              We believe that the Godhead eternally exists in three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit. These three are one God, having precisely the same nature, attributes and perfections,
and are worthy of precisely the same homage, confidence and obedience (Mark 12:29; John
1:1-4; Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 5:3-4).
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">Jesus Christ</h3>
            <p class="base-text">We believe in the total deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. We believe He is the manifestation of God
in the flesh. We believe He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. We
believe Him to be true God and true man (John 1:1, 1:14, 1:18; John 14:8-9; 1 Timothy 3:16).</p>

            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">Holy Spirit</h3>
            <p class="base-text">We believe in the total deity of the Holy Spirit and that His ministry is to glorify the Lord Jesus
Christ (John 16:14). The Holy Spirit regenerates the sinner upon belief in Christ, baptizing the
believer into one body of which Christ is the head. The Holy Spirit indwells, guides, instructs,
fills, comforts and empowers the believer for godly living (Mark 13:11; John 14:26; John 16:13;
Romans 5:5; 1 Corinthians 3:16). The Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin, of God’s
righteousness and of coming judgment (John 16:8-11).</p>

            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">Scriptures</h3>
            <p class="base-text">We believe the Scriptures of the Old Testament and New Testament are verbally inspired by
God and inerrant in their original writings. We believe the 66 books of the Old Testament and the
New Testament are God’s complete and sufficient revelation and therefore carry God’s authority
for the total well-being of mankind (Psalm 119:97-104; Psalm 119:160; Matthew 5:18; John
5:46-47; John 10:35; 2 Timothy 3:15-16).</p>

            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">Man</h3>
            <p class="base-text">We believe man was created in innocence under the law of his Maker but, by voluntarily
transgressing, fell from his sinless and happy state. Consequently, all mankind is sinful. All
people are sinners not only by inheritance, but by their own choice and therefore are under just
condemnation without defense or excuse. We believe that without exception every man and
every woman is totally depraved and needs a Savior (Genesis 3:1-6; Romans 3:10-19; Romans
1:18; Romans 1:32; Romans 5:1-2).</p>

            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">Salvation</h3>
            <p class="base-text">We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, as a
representative and substitutionary sacrifice. We believe that each person who by faith receives
Him as Savior is justified on the basis of Jesus Christ’s shed blood on Calvary. Each person
who receives Christ as Savior is born again of the Holy Spirit and thereby becomes eternally
secure as a child of God. We believe the Holy Spirit baptizes each believing person into the
body of Christ at the moment of salvation and that there is no second baptism of the Holy Spirit
(Romans 8:37-39; 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Corinthians 12:13).</p>

            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">Resurrection</h3>
            <p class="base-text">We believe in the resurrection of the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, His ascension into heaven
and His present life for us as High Priest and Advocate (Acts 1:3; Acts 1:9; Hebrews 7:25-26).</p>

            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">Heaven, Hell and The Return Of Christ</h3>
            <p class="base-text">We believe in the “blessed hope:” the promised return of the Lord Jesus Christ. We believe in
the bodily resurrection of both the saved and the lost. The saved are raised to eternal,
conscious bliss in heaven (Matthew 25:34; John 14:2; 2 Corinthians 5:1; Revelation 2:7), and
the lost are raised to eternal torment in hell in conscious separation from God (Matthew 8:11;
Matthew 10:28; Matthew 13:49-50; Mark 9:47-48; Luke 12:5; Revelation 21:8).</p>

            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">Christian Living (Concerning Conduct)</h3>
            <p class="base-text">The Bible teaches that all believers are saints, set apart unto God and are thus responsible to
live in such a manner as not to bring reproach upon their Savior and Lord (Romans 21:1-2; 2
Timothy 2:19; Titus 2; 1 Peter 1:14-19) lest the Word of God be blasphemed (1 Timothy 6:1;
Titus 2:5). As Christians we should obey the Word of our Lord, seek the things which are above,
walk as He walked, and accept as our responsibility the duty and privilege of bearing the Gospel
to a lost world (1 John 2:3; Colossians 3:1; Ephesians 5:23; Matthew 29:19-20). A victorious
and fruitful Christian life is possible only for those who have presented themselves wholly to
Christ and walk by the power of the Holy Spirit, which all believers are called to do (Romans
12:1-2; Galatians 5:16; Ephesians 5:18; Romans 6-7).</p>

            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">Creation, Evolution, and God’s Sovereignty</h3>
            <p class="base-text">We believe God created the universe in six 24-hour days and that, before He created the
universe, nothing except God existed. (Genesis 1; Exodus 31:17; Psalm 33:6-9; Acts 17:24;
Hebrews 11:3;Colossians 1:16)</p>
            <p class="base-text">God chose to create the universe and all that is in it to reveal His glory, divine nature, eternal
power, infinite wisdom and supreme authority. (Isaiah 43:7; Psalm 19:1-2; Jeremiah 10:12;
Romans 1:20;Revelation 4:11)</p>
            <p class="base-text">We deny the theory of evolution, which states that nonliving substances gave rise to the first
living material, which then reproduced and diversified to produce all living creatures. We believe
that all people are descendants of Adam and Eve, whom God created personally and

individually and as complete human beings. (Genesis 1:26-27; Genesis 2:7; Genesis 2:21-22; 1
Corinthians 11:8-9) The fall of Adam and Eve infected all people with sin and death, but the
death and resurrection of Jesus Christ gives the opportunity to receive God’s gift of eternal life.
(Romans 5:18-19; 1 Corinthians 15:21-22)</p>
            <p class="base-text">God rules over His creation and cares about and is involved in the lives of individual people.
(Job 12:10; Acts 17:25; Acts 25:28; Colossians 1:17; Hebrews 1:13; Ephesians 4:6)</p>


            <h3 class="heading-tretiary">Sufficiency of Scripture</h3>
            <p class="base-text">We believe in the verbal, plenary inspiration of that Scriptures and that they contain all the
words of God that we need in order to completely trust and obey Him. The Scriptures are
inerrant in their original writings, (Psalm 119:97-104; Psalm 119:160; Matthew 5:18; John
5:46-47; John 10:35; 2 Timothy 3:15-16) and are infallible in their instruction, (Proverbs 6:32; 2
Peter 1:19) eternal in duration, (Isaiah 40:8;1 Peter 1:23-25) the final authority and the standard
for faith and practice (Matthew 4:4; Psalm 119), and sufficient for counsel in every issue of life.
(Psalm 19:14-17; 2 Timothy 3:16) We believe the very words of Scripture in the original Hebrew,
Greek, and Aramaic are inspired by God.</p>
