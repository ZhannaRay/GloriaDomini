            <p class="base-text">
              Our Upper School serves students in the dialectic and rhetoric stages, focusing deeply on
debate, philosophy, integration, and meaningful conversation. Through these disciplines,
students cultivate a biblical worldview and develop a love for truth, goodness, and beauty
across all areas of study.
            </p>
            <p class="base-text">
              We emphasize a robust Christian education by guiding discussions through the five common
topics—definition, comparison, relationship, circumstance, and testimony—applied to the texts,
questions, and work explored throughout the curriculum. As students progress into the rhetoric
stage, they embrace the canons of rhetoric, with particular emphasis on invention, arrangement,
and elocution. The program culminates in Latin fluency and a senior thesis that showcases
years of classical education. Additionally, both our upper and lower school programs join
together first thing in the morning for our large group assembly (Symposium),
            </p>
            <p class="base-text">We utilize the Master Point curriculum, a 32-week program, with a few modifications.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-tretiary">Class Structure and Scheduling</h2>
          <p  class="base-text">Students in each grade or class generally take all their classes together to promote integration
and a strong classroom dynamic, with a few exceptions:</p>
            <ul class="base-text">
              <li class="text-tab">Latin classes for all levels are scheduled at the same time.
This allows students to attend the Latin class that matches their current level, ensuring
they:
                <ul>
                  <li class="text-tab">Progress only when ready</li>
                  <li class="text-tab">Can join at the appropriate level if they are new to the program</li>
                  <li class="text-tab">Experience Latin as the cornerstone of our classical education</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="text-tab">If a student joins the program having already completed a level their class is currently
studying, tutors will coordinate so the student can attend a different science class at that
time to study a lower-level course.</li>
              <li class="text-tab">When enrollment in a particular grade or age group is low, classes may be combined
with adjacent levels. In such cases, content will cycle accordingly, with separate
breakouts for sequential subjects where level differences are most significant—such as
Latin. These decisions will be made at the discretion of the director, upper school
coordinator, and parents. We believe this flexibility strengthens the Colloquium program,
ensuring its depth and vitality. Accordingly, the grades assigned to each Master Point
curriculum level may vary slightly by class.</li>

            <span class="text-underline">Climb 1 (7th Grade)- Science Fair</span></br>
            The Climb 1 Colloquium will participate in the Science Fair as their capstone project. Students
will work through the scientific process—developing a research question, forming a hypothesis,
conducting background research, designing and executing an experiment, and drawing
conclusions. Each student will produce a formal research paper and create a tri-fold display
board. They will present their findings at a community science fair before an audience and a
panel of judges.</p>
          <p  class="base-text">
            <span class="text-underline">Climb 2- Mock Trial</span></br>
            Students will participate in Mock Trial: People vs. Klein by the Constitution Rights Foundation,
gaining practical experience in courtroom procedures, legal terminology, and trial roles. Through
preparing and presenting arguments, they will develop public speaking, critical thinking,
problem-solving, research, and collaboration skills. The process also fosters empathy by
requiring students to understand and articulate multiple perspectives.

            <span class="text-underline">Climb 3 through Summit 2- Protocol</span></br>
            We aim to provide a Protocal outing annually for our 9th through 12th graders to offer students
the opportunity to practice formal etiquette, enjoy meaningful conversation, and cultivate poise
and confidence in a social setting.
          </p>
          <p  class="base-text">
            <span class="text-underline">Climb 3- Economics Project</span></br>
            Life can surprise us, but we can equip students to navigate its twists and turns with confidence.
This project offers a practical approach for high school students to build personal finance skills.
Through interactive activities, students explore topics like career, family, housing, and
unexpected events, helping them understand and manage their economic future.
          </p>
          <p  class="base-text">
            <span class="text-underline"></span>Climb 4- Debate</br>
            After studying the elements of debate, students will engage in their own debate where they flex
both their dialectic and rhetorical skills in the showcase of the discernment of truth, goodness,
and beauty.
          </p>
          <p  class="base-text">
            <span class="text-underline">Summit 1- Shakespearean Play or Poetry Cafe</span></br>
            To celebrate their study of British literature, students will attend a Shakespearean play with their
tutor. If a local production is not available, alternative options may include viewing a play based
on another work of British literature, traveling to a nearby city for a performance, or, if necessary,
watching a film adaptation. Another meaningful alternative could be a Poetry Café experience,
where students memorize and perform favorite Shakespearean sonnets or passages in a
relaxed, literary setting.
          </p>
          <p  class="base-text">
            <span class="text-underline">Summit 2- Senior Exhibition/Thesis</span></br>
            The Exhibition is a public demonstration of a student's knowledge, skills, and readiness to
engage as an educated adult. Over 15 weeks, students independently research a societal issue
of personal interest, develop an action plan, and collaborate with advisors and relevant
organizations. They design, implement, and evaluate a sustainable project addressing the
issue, then present their findings and process to a jury through oral, visual, and portfolio
presentations. This culminating project emphasizes depth, community engagement, and student
initiative, serving as a final demonstration of mastery before graduation.
